# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Overview and Purpose


## Resources
- Data: MechaCar_mpg.csv, Suspension_Coil.csv
- Programming Languages: R v. 4.1.3

## Summary
### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A multiple linear regression was performed on raw data using vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, and AWD (All Wheel Drive) as independent variables and mpg (miles per gallon) as the dependent variable from the MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset. Significance was set at 0.05.  Results showed that vehicle_length and ground_clearance were both statistically significant  (P < 0.001), so provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset (Fig. 1). The overall P-value (< 0.001) indicates that the slope is not considered to be zero as the predictor variables produce changes in the response variable (in this case, mpg). The intercept was also highly significant (P < 0.001). R-squared was found to be 0.715, indicating that the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
